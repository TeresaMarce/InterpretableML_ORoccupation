## Thesis Abstract:

Nowadays, the potential of using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to solve real-world problems is exceptionally closed to be realized, and many are the application domains such as cyber security, aviation and healthcare, where there is in-depth research into their applicability. With the amount of data currently gathered in the hospital environment, models capable of learning and improving automatically through the use of data might solve problems that endanger the proper functioning of hospitals. The Operating Room (OR) is a high-cost environment, and its usage must be efficient. Therefore, our presented solution focuses on developing interpretable prediction ML models for an operating theater decision support system to improve the prediction of surgical times, comparing them with traditional methods to aid the OR scheduling process. We implemented three different ML models, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), RuleFit and a deep neural network, and we compared and analyzed their performance, including both accuracy and interpretability. For each of these algorithms, we implemented three different strategies. Then, since surgical durations showed a significant imbalance and this is known to hinder the performance of accuracy-based ML algorithms, we trained a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn the probability distribution on the minority values of our label and the performance of balanced and imbalanced datasets was compared using the Utility-Based Algorithm (UBA). The research work is an evidence that the proper implementation of interpretable ML technologies can significantly improve current standards of estimation, representing a cost reduction from an operationâ€™s perspective, maintaining decision-makers' confidence in the system.
